## Introduction

"Learn Rust by Mistakes: The No-Frills Edition" is a limited-sharing e-book released under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license. It introduces the Rust programming language through a unique approach: learning by encountering and overcoming common pitfalls. This book explores typical traps and errors faced while learning and using Rust, making the learning process more engaging, enjoyable, and motivating.

This book is ideal for readers with experience in at least one programming language. If you're new to programming, we suggest starting with popular languages like Python, mastering the basics—perhaps with the aid of generative AI—before diving into Rust. Once you've grasped fundamental programming concepts, this book will guide you through Rust's core features. By learning from mistakes, you'll gain a deeper understanding of Rust's strengths and how to apply them effectively.

The book divides Rust's introductory knowledge into three parts, each corresponding to a hands-on project. Each chapter's content revolves around the knowledge needed to complete that project. This structure allows readers to quickly apply what they've learned, deepening their understanding of Rust.

**If you enjoy this e-book, please give it a star⭐️!**

The chapter titles in this book will be continually optimized and adjusted throughout the writing process.
