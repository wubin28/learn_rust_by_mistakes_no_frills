# Chapter 1 Avoiding C++-style Memory Safety Pitfalls

# 1.1 Born to Avoid C++ Memory Safety Issues

On January 25, 2003, security expert Aryeh Goretsky received an urgent call—chaos had erupted in the company's server room. The culprit? The SQL Slammer worm, exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server—a product written in C++. This incident paralyzed thousands of networks globally, dealing a severe blow to the internet.

Fifteen years earlier, in 1988, history had repeated itself. A vulnerability in the Unix system, also written in C, fell prey to the Morris worm, crippling about 10% of internet systems. While C and C++ offer stellar performance, they treat memory safety as optional. This approach relies primarily on programmers' voluntary adherence to best practices and third-party tool checks, rather than built-in language safeguards—a recipe for security risks.

Fast forward to 2006. C++ programmer Graydon Hoare found himself trudging up 21 floors to his apartment, courtesy of a crashed elevator running on faulty embedded software. Frustration turned to inspiration, and Hoare resolved to develop a new programming language that would make memory safety non-negotiable. Thus, Rust was born.

In 2009, the Rust project was launched. The following year, Mozilla formed the Rust team and began incubating this innovative language. Rust 1.0 was officially released to the public in 2015.

Programmers fell in love with Rust. Since 2016, Rust has topped Stack Overflow's "Most Loved Programming Languages" list for 9 consecutive years.

Apart from Apple, the other four major U.S. tech giants have embraced Rust. Facebook took the lead in 2016, using it to develop a large-scale source code management system. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have also successively applied Rust to key projects such as Azure IoT Edge, AWS Lambda, and Fuchsia. After Google introduced Rust in Android development, the proportion of memory safety vulnerabilities plummeted from 76% to 24%.

Even Linux creator Linus Torvalds has acknowledged Rust's potential to become the third official development language for the Linux kernel, alongside C and assembly. This potential became reality in 2023 when the first Rust driver was integrated into the Linux 6.8 kernel.

The U.S. government's call to abandon C/C++ in favor of memory-safe languages like Rust has exerted significant pressure on the industry. In response, C++ creator Bjarne Stroustrup conceded that external tools alone cannot guarantee memory safety in C++, emphasizing the need for changes to the language itself. This led to the C++ Alliance proposing the "Safe C++ Extension Proposal" in September 2024, which introduces strict memory safety features inspired by Rust.

It's clear that Rust has not only tackled the persistent memory safety issues that have long plagued C/C++, but has also challenged C/C++'s half-century dominance in systems and high-performance programming. This shift marks the dawn of a new era in software engineering, one where safety takes center stage.

# 1.2 Dangling Hazards of C++ Smart Pointers

C++, an extension of the C language, debuted in 1985 under the guidance of Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. His goal? To introduce object-oriented programming features to C. This powerful and flexible language has since become a favorite across numerous fields, particularly shining in high-performance scenarios. From system software and game development to embedded systems, real-time computing, and high-performance computing, C++ reigns supreme. Its popularity in applications demanding fine-grained control over hardware and resources stems from its efficient memory management, support for low-level programming, and direct hardware access features.

The 2023 JetBrains Global Developer Ecosystem Survey reveals that [25% of surveyed programmers used C++ in the past year](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2023/languages/), ranking it fourth behind JavaScript, Python, and Java. At the time of writing, JetBrains' data indicates that [C++17 is the most widely adopted version among C++ programmers](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2023/cpp/).

C++, despite its widespread use, has long grappled with the issue of dangling pointers. These pointers, a common pitfall in languages requiring manual memory management like C/C++, can lead to dire consequences: unpredictable data, memory safety vulnerabilities, and even program crashes.

A dangling pointer occurs when, during program execution, a pointer falls into one of these precarious situations:

- Pointing to deallocated memory: The pointer's target memory has been freed (e.g., via a delete operation), yet the pointer itself remains unchanged, still gesturing toward the now-freed memory area.
- Pointing to reallocated memory: The pointer's target memory has been reassigned to other data (e.g., reallocated on the heap), but the pointer hasn't been updated and continues to indicate the old memory address.
- Pointing to expired local variable data: The pointer references data from a local variable that has gone out of scope and become invalid. In this scenario, the pointer is left indicating invalidated stack memory.

In essence, a dangling pointer is a "false promise"—it points to memory that's either invalid or repurposed for other data. Dereferencing such a pointer triggers undefined behavior, a notorious trap in C/C++ programming. The following code illustrates this common pitfall:

```cpp
int* createInt() {
    // local is a local variable, 
    // its memory becomes invalid after the function returns
    int local = 55;
    return &local; // Returning the address of a local variable
}

// p still points to this invalid memory, 
// becoming a dangling pointer
int* p = createInt();
```

C++'s approach to handling dangling pointers has evolved over time. Initially, before C++98, it relied solely on manual memory management, which was error-prone. C++98/03 introduced `auto_ptr`, a smart pointer that simplified memory management but had limitations. C++11 made significant strides by introducing more robust smart pointers: `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, and `weak_ptr`. These greatly reduced dangling pointer issues. Subsequent versions—C++14, 17, and 20—further encouraged smart pointer usage and introduced features to minimize the need for manual memory management.

Despite the substantial improvements in dynamic memory management brought by C++11's smart pointers, they didn't entirely eliminate the dangling pointer problem. Programmers must still exercise caution in pointer management and adhere to best practices like RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) to avoid dangling pointers.

Nevertheless, even with smart pointers, C++ remains susceptible to certain memory-related pitfalls.

## 1.2.1 Falling into the Trap

Can you spot the hidden danger in Code Listing 1-1? Why not run the code and see for yourself? The easiest way to execute C++ code is to copy and paste it into the left editing area at [www.mycompiler.io/new/cpp](https://www.mycompiler.io/new/cpp). Then, click the Run button in the top right corner. You'll see the results appear on the right side.

Code Listing 1-1 ch01/cpp_dangling_ptr

```cpp
// Include the input/output stream library for console output using std::cout
#include <iostream>
// Include the memory management library for smart pointer support like std::shared_ptr
#include <memory>

int main()
{
  // Create a raw pointer, initialized to nullptr, 
  // indicating it doesn't point to any valid memory address
  int* rawPtr = nullptr;

  {  // Start a new scope to limit the lifetime of smartPtr
    // Create smart pointer smartPtr, 
    // pointing to an int object with value 55,
    // std:: indicates that shared_ptr is a smart pointer provided by the C++ standard library
    std::shared_ptr<int> smartPtr = std::make_shared<int>(55);
    rawPtr = smartPtr.get();  // Get the raw pointer managed by the smart pointer

    std::cout << "Value managed by smart pointer: " << *smartPtr << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Value pointed to by raw pointer: " << *rawPtr << std::endl;
  }  // smartPtr is destroyed at the end of this scope, managed memory is released

  // At this point, rawPtr becomes a dangling pointer
  // Undefined behavior, may see different values in different environments, 
  // or may crash
  std::cout << "Attempting to access value of dangling raw pointer: " << *rawPtr
            << std::endl;  

  return 0;
}
// Run output:
// Value managed by smart pointer: 55
// Value pointed to by raw pointer: 55
// Attempting to access value of dangling raw pointer: 0
```

## 1.2.2 Why We Fall into This Trap

Code Listing 1-1 illustrates the process of extracting a raw pointer from a C++ smart pointer and the pitfalls that come with it. The code executes these key steps:

1. It creates and manages an integer using a smart pointer.
2. It extracts a raw pointer from this smart pointer.
3. Once the smart pointer is destroyed, the raw pointer becomes a dangling pointer, still pointing to the now-freed memory.
4. The code then attempts to use this dangling pointer, showcasing the inherent dangers of such an operation.

The hidden danger in Code Listing 1-1 lies in C++'s permissive approach to bidirectional conversion between smart pointers and raw pointers. While this flexibility offers convenience, it's a double-edged sword—careless use can easily spawn dangling pointer issues.

The run results reveal the treacherous nature of accessing a dangling pointer. You might get 0 on your local machine, or 55 on the [mycompiler.io](http://mycompiler.io) webpage. This unpredictability is a ticking time bomb, potentially triggering program crashes or opening the door to security vulnerabilities.

This example serves as a stark reminder of the risks lurking in the shadows when obtaining raw pointers from C++ smart pointers. Once a smart pointer bites the dust, any raw pointers derived from it transform into dangerous dangling pointers. The takeaway? When wielding smart pointers, treat raw pointers with kid gloves to dodge the dangling pointer bullet.

# 1.3 Sidestepping Smart Pointer Pitfalls with Rust References

How does Rust ingeniously prevent references derived from smart pointers from becoming dangling, thus avoiding a common C++ trap?

## 1.3.1 Dodging C++-style Dangling Hazards

Let's dive into Code Listing 1-2 to uncover Rust's clever solution to this thorny issue.

Code Listing 1-2 ch01/avoid_dangling_ptrs_with_refs/pitfalls

```rust
1 fn main() {
2     // Declare a variable named reference, but don't initialize it yet
3     let reference;
4 
5     { // Start a new scope
6         // Bind a smart pointer smart_ptr of type Box<i32>, storing the integer value 55, Box allocates memory on the heap
7         let smart_ptr = Box::new(55);
8         // The type of variable reference will only be inferred when it's initialized here
9         // Explanation of the expression &*smart_ptr:
10         // First, the * dereference operator dereferences the Box smart pointer to its i32 value managed on the heap
11         // Then the & reference creation operator creates a reference to this heap value
12         // Finally, this reference is initialized to the variable reference
13         reference = &*smart_ptr;
14 
15         println!("Value managed by smart pointer: {}", smart_ptr);
16 
17         println!("Value pointed to by reference: {}", reference);
18     } // smart_ptr is destroyed when this scope ends
19 
20     // Attempting to use the dangling reference will result in a compilation error
21     println!("Value pointed to by reference: {}", reference);
22 }
23 // Compilation error:
24 // error[E0597]: `*smart_ptr` does not live long enough
```

Unlike the C++ code in Listing 1-1, Rust's compiler prevents the code in Listing 1-2—which contains dangling references—from running. While C++ code with dangling pointers can still compile and "run with errors," leading to undefined behavior, Rust detects such issues at compile time. For brevity, Listing 1-2 only displays the first line of the compilation error message.

Skeptical? Why not compile and run the code yourself using the method described next? You'll witness Rust's safety guarantees firsthand.

How to Run the Rust Code in Listing 1-2

The easiest way is to copy and paste the code (without line numbers) into the left editing area at [www.mycompiler.io/new/rust](https://www.mycompiler.io/new/rust). Click the Run button in the top right corner to see the results on the right side.

To run it on your local machine, follow these steps (for brevity, only key points are provided—consult your favorite AI chat tool for detailed instructions):

1. Install Rust: Use rustup.
2. Verify installation: Run `rustc --version`.
3. Create a project: Run `cargo new hello_world_rust` (replace `hello_world_rust` with your project name).
4. Format code: Run `cargo fmt`.
5. Check syntax: Run `cargo check`.
6. Compile: Run `cargo build`. This generates the compilation result in the target/debug folder.
7. Run: Execute `cargo run`.
8. Run Listing 1-2: Replace the code in `./src/main.rs` with Listing 1-2 (without line numbers), then repeat the formatting, checking, compiling, and running steps.

The Rust compiler boasts a powerful tool—the borrow checker. This sentinel begins its vigil during compilation, with four primary responsibilities:

- Monitoring the lifespan of every variable and reference
- Ensuring references don't outlast their pointed values
- Scrutinizing the usage scope of all variables and references
- Verifying the validity of all references at the point of use

In essence, the borrow checker's mission is to nip dangling reference issues in the bud, long before the program ever runs.

When the borrow checker sniffs out a potential dangling reference, it promptly sounds the alarm with a compilation error. This means the code won't compile until the issue is resolved, significantly bolstering program safety.

Take Code Listing 1-2, for instance. Here, the `reference` variable attempts to grasp a reference to `smart_ptr`'s dereferenced value (via `&*smart_ptr`). But there's a catch—`smart_ptr` vanishes when its scope ends. The Rust compiler, with its keen eye, spots that `reference` would outlive `smart_ptr`, leading to an invalid reference. Swiftly and decisively, the compiler flags an error, blocking the code from running. This preemptive strike effectively eliminates the memory safety risks that dangling references pose.

## 1.3.2 Fixing Rust's Compilation Error

The dangling reference trap in Code Listing 1-2 occurs because `reference` outlives `smart_ptr`. How can we sidestep this issue?

The most straightforward solution is to ensure `reference` doesn't outlast `smart_ptr`. We can achieve this in two ways:

1. Remove the scope braces on lines 5 and 18, extending `smart_ptr`'s lifetime.
2. Split `smart_ptr`'s binding on line 7 into declaration and initialization, moving the declaration before the scope braces on line 5.

Both methods ensure that `reference` and `smart_ptr`, while potentially created at different times, share the same lifespan—effectively thwarting any chance of dangling references. Let's take a look at how the second approach plays out in Code Listing 1-3:

Code Listing 1-3 ch01/avoid_dangling_ptrs_with_refs/mitigation

```rust
fn main() {
    let reference;
    let smart_ptr;

    {
        smart_ptr = Box::new(55);
        reference = &*smart_ptr;

        println!("Value managed by smart pointer: {}", smart_ptr);
        println!("Value pointed to by reference: {}", reference);
    }

    println!("Value pointed to by reference: {}", reference);
}
// Runtime output:
// Value managed by smart pointer: 55
// Value pointed to by reference: 55
// Value pointed to by reference: 55
```

# 1.4 Dangling Traps in Rust Smart Pointers

While Rust's borrow checker effectively prevents most dangling reference issues, certain special cases—particularly when dealing with raw pointers—require extra vigilance.

## 1.4.1 Falling into the Trap

Can improper use of raw pointers in Rust lead to smart pointer dangling traps similar to those in C++? To find out, let's run the code in Code Listing 1-4 multiple times and observe the result of the last line of output.

Code Listing 1-4 ch01/dangling_ptr_from_smart_ptr/pitfalls

```rust
1 fn main() {
2     // Declare a variable, but don't initialize it yet
3     let raw_ptr;
4
5     { // Start a new scope
6         let smart_ptr = Box::new(55);
7         // Get a raw pointer from the smart pointer
8         raw_ptr = &*smart_ptr as *const i32;
9
10         println!("Value managed by smart pointer: {}", smart_ptr);
11         unsafe {
12             println!("Value pointed to by raw pointer: {}", *raw_ptr);
13         }
14     } // smart_ptr is destroyed at the end of this scope, the memory it points to is freed
15
16     // Attempt to use the dangling pointer raw_ptr
17     unsafe {
18         // Compiles successfully, produces undefined behavior at runtime
19         println!("Attempting to access value pointed to by dangling raw pointer (different each run): {}", *raw_ptr);
20     }
21 }
22 // Runtime output:
23 // Value managed by smart pointer: 55
24 // Value pointed to by raw pointer: 55
25 // Attempting to access value pointed to by dangling raw pointer (different each run): -693338112
```

## 1.4.2 Understanding the Trap

When we run the code in Code Listing 1-4 multiple times, the value pointed to by the dangling raw pointer in the final output line varies. Let's explore why this occurs.

On line 6, we define the smart pointer `smart_ptr` within a local scope `{ ... }`, allocating an integer on the heap via `Box::new(55)`. Line 8 then employs `&*smart_ptr as *const i32` to convert the reference to `smart_ptr`'s heap-managed value into a raw pointer, initializing `raw_ptr`.

The syntax `*const i32` denotes a constant (immutable) raw pointer to an `i32`. Here, `as` performs explicit type conversion, `*` signifies a pointer type, `const` indicates the pointed-to data is immutable, and `i32` specifies the data type. This conversion transforms a safe Rust reference into an unsafe raw pointer, unrestricted by borrowing rules. While raw pointers offer flexibility, they demand extreme caution as they circumvent Rust's memory safety guarantees.

As the local scope concludes, `smart_ptr` is destroyed and its pointed-to memory freed. Though `raw_ptr` persists, it now points to invalid memory, becoming a dangling pointer. This raw pointer no longer references valid data, and its continued use leads to undefined behavior—hence the varying output values across program runs.

While we've encountered a dangling pointer issue in Rust, it's crucial to note that this problem only surfaces within `unsafe` code blocks. Rust requires the `unsafe` keyword when using raw pointers, unlike C++ which doesn't mandate special marking. Through these `unsafe` blocks, Rust explicitly signals to programmers: "Here, you're responsible for ensuring memory safety."

## 1.4.3 Avoiding the Trap

How can we resolve the dangling trap of Rust smart pointers in Code Listing 1-4? Can we apply the techniques learned in 1.3.2 to address this issue?

We have at least two solutions. The first mirrors the approach discussed in 1.3.2: we can either remove the curly braces on lines 5 and 14, or split `smart_ptr`'s declaration and initialization, placing the declaration before the opening curly brace on line 5. This ensures that `raw_ptr` doesn't outlive `smart_ptr`, as demonstrated in Code Listing 1-5:

Code Listing 1-5 ch01/dangling_ptr_from_smart_ptr/mitigation

```rust
fn main() {
    let raw_ptr;
    let smart_ptr;

    {
        smart_ptr = Box::new(55);
        raw_ptr = &*smart_ptr as *const i32;

        println!("Value managed by smart pointer: {}", smart_ptr);
        unsafe {
            println!("Value pointed to by raw pointer: {}", *raw_ptr);
        }
    }

    unsafe {
        println!(
            "Attempting to access value pointed to by dangling raw pointer: {}",
            *raw_ptr
        );
    }
}
// Runtime output:
// Value managed by smart pointer: 55
// Value pointed to by raw pointer: 55
// Attempting to access value pointed to by dangling raw pointer: 55
```

The second solution avoids raw pointers altogether: replace `raw_ptr` with a Rust reference. This approach harnesses the full power of Rust's borrow checker, ensuring at compile-time that all references are dangling-free—a safety net we explored in Section 1.3.
